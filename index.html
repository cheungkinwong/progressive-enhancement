        <h2>The story</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><q class="farmer">“<em>maybe</em>.”</q></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” </q>The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">“<em>maybe</em>.”</q> 
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">“Oh dear, that’s too <a class="bad">Bad</a>,” </q>and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">“<em>maybe</em>.”</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">“Isn’t that great!” </q>Again, he said, <q class="farmer">“<em>maybe</em>.”</q>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <a class="good">Good</a> or <a class="bad">Bad</a> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <a class="good">Good</a> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>  
        <p>
            <a class="good">Good</a> and <a class="bad">Bad</a> are just one perspective. Bananas are <a class="good">Good</a> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <a class="good">Good</a> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
